Here are several detailed user stories based on the LibXAI Suite project context, along with acceptance criteria for each. These user stories focus on different user types who would interact with the Gantt chart and AI functionalities of the suite.

### User Story 1: Project Manager - Task Scheduling
**As a** Project Manager, **I want** the ability to optimize task scheduling using AI algorithms **so that** I can ensure my project is completed on time and resources are utilized efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system should automatically suggest the optimal sequence of tasks based on dependencies and resource availability.
2. The user should be able to view and manually adjust the suggested task order if needed.
3. The system should provide a visual representation of the optimized task schedule on the Gantt chart.
4. The system should allow the user to save and revert to previous task schedules.

### User Story 2: Team Member - Real-Time Collaboration
**As a** Team Member, **I want** to collaborate in real-time on the Gantt chart **so that** I can contribute updates and changes to tasks as they occur without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Multiple users should be able to edit the Gantt chart simultaneously, and updates should reflect in real-time.
2. The system should display the usernames of team members currently viewing or editing the chart.
3. Changes made by one user should trigger an alert to other users currently editing the same task.
4. The system should maintain a version history of changes made to tasks, allowing users to track updates.

### User Story 3: Project Analyst - Predictive Analytics
**As a** Project Analyst, **I want** the system to provide predictive analytics for project timelines **so that** I can identify potential delays and mitigate risks proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system should analyze historical project data and provide estimated completion dates for current tasks.
2. The system should highlight tasks that are likely to become bottlenecks using visual cues on the Gantt chart.
3. Users should receive notifications when a predicted delay is identified for any task.
4. The system should suggest alternative strategies to mitigate identified risks, which the user can review and implement.

### User Story 4: Resource Manager - Resource Allocation 
**As a** Resource Manager, **I want** the system to automatically allocate resources to tasks based on availability and skill set **so that** I can optimize team performance and avoid conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system should display a list of available resources and their corresponding skills.
2. The system should automatically assign resources to tasks based on their availability and expertise.
3. Users should be able to override automatic assignments and make manual adjustments.
4. The system should notify users of resource conflicts and suggest resolutions.

### User Story 5: Developer - Task Updates
**As a** Developer, **I want** to update the status of my assigned tasks in the Gantt chart **so that** I can keep my project manager informed about my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Developers should be able to change the status of tasks (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed) directly from the Gantt chart.
2. The system should automatically update the project timeline based on the status changes of tasks.
3. Users should receive a confirmation prompt before finalizing status updates to prevent accidental changes.
4. The system should log all status updates with timestamps and user information for accountability.

### User Story 6: Stakeholder - Multi-Project View
**As a** Stakeholder, **I want** to view multiple project timelines in a unified dashboard **so that** I can monitor the overall progress of various projects at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system should provide a dashboard view that consolidates timelines from multiple projects.
2. Users should be able to filter and select specific projects to display based on their interests.
3. The dashboard should visually indicate the health status of each project (e.g., On Track, At Risk, Delayed).
4. Users should be able to drill down into each project to view detailed Gantt charts for individual tasks.
