### Key Considerations
- **High Influence/High Interest Stakeholders**: These stakeholders require regular updates and active engagement strategies to ensure their needs and expectations are met.
- **Medium Influence/Medium Interest Stakeholders**: They should receive periodic updates and be involved in key discussions to maintain their support and address any concerns they may have.
- **Low Influence/Low Interest Stakeholders**: While they are not critical, it is still important to keep them informed to foster goodwill and potential future engagement.

### Engagement Strategy Overview
- **Regular Status Meetings**: To keep stakeholders informed about project progress and address any concerns.
- **Collaborative Workshops**: Allowing for brainstorming and feedback sessions, especially with technical and creative teams.
- **User Feedback Sessions**: Engaging end-users and community contributors to gather insights that can influence design and functionality.
- **Documentation Reviews**: Ensuring that all stakeholders can contribute to and understand project documentation to enhance clarity.

### Notes
- This Stakeholder Register should be revisited throughout the project life cycle to update stakeholder information, interests, and engagement strategies as needed.
- Stakeholder feedback will be essential for the success of the LibXAI Suite, especially with its focus on user experience and community-driven improvements.

This Stakeholder Register will serve as a vital tool for managing relationships and ensuring that all stakeholders are appropriately engaged throughout the life of the LibXAI Suite project.
