# Scope Management Plan for LibXAI Suite

## 1. Introduction
The Scope Management Plan outlines how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled throughout the lifecycle of the LibXAI Suite project. This ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what is included in the project and helps manage any changes to the project scope effectively.

## 2. Scope Definition

### 2.1 Project Objectives
- To create an AI-powered Gantt chart library that enhances project management through intelligent automation and predictive analytics.
- To ensure the library is built with modern web technologies, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- To deliver a product that can be easily integrated into existing project management workflows.

### 2.2 Deliverables
The following deliverables are expected from the LibXAI Suite project:
1. **Gantt Chart Component**: A fully functional Gantt chart component built with React and TypeScript.
2. **AI Scheduler**: Algorithms for intelligent task scheduling, resource allocation, and risk assessment.
3. **User Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions and API references.
4. **Testing Suite**: A suite of unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
5. **Deployment Scripts**: Scripts for deploying the library to npm and for production environments.
6. **Support Channels**: Establishment of support channels including GitHub Issues and Discussions.

### 2.3 Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Task management capabilities (create, update, delete tasks).
  - AI-driven scheduling and resource allocation.
  - Real-time collaboration features.
  - Interactive and responsive user interface.
  
- **Non-functional Requirements**:
  - Performance metrics such as load time and responsiveness.
  - Cross-browser compatibility.
  - Accessibility compliance.

## 3. Scope Validation
### 3.1 Requirements Gathering
Requirements will be gathered through various methods:
- Stakeholder interviews
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Workshops and brainstorming sessions

### 3.2 Acceptance Criteria
Each deliverable will have specific acceptance criteria that must be met for the deliverable to be accepted. For example:
- The Gantt Chart must be able to handle over 1000 tasks without performance degradation.
- All functional requirements must be passed with a minimum of 90% test coverage.

### 3.3 Review Process
Deliverables will be reviewed and validated by stakeholders through:
- Regular project meetings
- Use of feedback forms
- Demonstrations of completed features

## 4. Scope Control
### 4.1 Change Management Process
Any changes to the project scope must be managed through a formal change management process:
1. **Change Request Submission**: Stakeholders must submit a change request form.
2. **Impact Analysis**: The project manager will assess the impact of the change on project time, cost, and resources.
3. **Review and Approval**: The change request will be presented to the project stakeholders for approval.
4. **Implementation**: Once approved, the change will be implemented, and relevant documentation will be updated.
  
### 4.2 Scope Monitoring
The project manager will regularly monitor the project scope through:
- Status meetings
- Progress tracking tools (e.g., Gantt charts, burndown charts)
- Performance metrics to ensure the project remains aligned with its objectives.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities
### 5.1 Project Team
- **Project Manager**: Responsible for overall project oversight, scope definition, and change management.
- **Business Analyst**: Gathers and documents requirements from stakeholders.
- **Developers**: Responsible for implementing the technical aspects of the project according to defined requirements.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that all deliverables meet the acceptance criteria and quality standards.

### 5.2 Stakeholders
- **Project Sponsor**: Provides project funding and resources, approves changes.
- **End Users**: Provide feedback on usability and functionality.

## 6. Conclusion
The Scope Management Plan for the LibXAI Suite project ensures that all aspects of the project scope are carefully defined, validated, and controlled. This structured approach helps mitigate risks related to scope creep and supports the successful delivery of a high-quality product that meets stakeholder expectations. Regular updates and communication with stakeholders will be vital to maintaining alignment and ensuring project success.
