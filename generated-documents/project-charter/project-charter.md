# Project Charter for LibXAI Suite

## Project Title:
**LibXAI Suite: Generador de Diagramas de Gantt con Inteligencia Artificial para Gesti√≥n Inteligente de Proyectos**

## Project Purpose and Justification:
The LibXAI Suite aims to revolutionize project management by providing a state-of-the-art Gantt chart library powered by advanced artificial intelligence. The purpose of the project is to automate the scheduling of tasks, improve resource allocation, and enhance risk assessment through predictive analytics, which will ultimately lead to more efficient project delivery and better outcomes. By leveraging cutting-edge web technologies, the LibXAI Suite addresses the increasing demand for intelligent project management tools in various domains, including software development, construction, marketing, and research.

## Objectives:
1. Develop a fully functional Gantt chart library that integrates advanced AI algorithms for task scheduling and resource allocation.
2. Implement a responsive user interface for managing project timelines across multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
3. Enable real-time collaboration features to facilitate team communication and updates.
4. Ensure compatibility with modern web standards and major browsers to maximize accessibility and usability.
5. Achieve a performance benchmark of managing over 1000 tasks with real-time updates under 100ms response time.

## High-Level Requirements:
- Integration of AI functionalities for intelligent task scheduling and predictive analytics.
- Support for drag-and-drop task management and real-time updates.
